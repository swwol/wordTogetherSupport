**Word Together** is a fun word guessing game you can play alone or with your friends. To play with friends, call your friend on FaceTime, then press the SharePlay button in the Word Together app to start a new game. In single player mode you must guess the word within six tries. In SharePlay mode, the first player to guess correctly wins. The colour coded hints will help point you in the right direction.
